# Generator libraries for phoneCodeOscillator.

These are the libraries used when you want to use PCO to translate ascii text to CW. Depending on the configuration of your device and your goals you might save text files to the SD card, translate text received over serial, WiFi, or Bluetooth, or text to speach. You've got a great-bit uProcessor there, so the sky's the limit.

## Usage

TBD.
