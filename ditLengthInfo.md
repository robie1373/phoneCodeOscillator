# Dit Length calculations can be made with the following info.

"The speed of Morse code is typically specified in "words per minute" (WPM). In text-book, full-speed Morse, a dah is conventionally 3 times as long as a dit. The spacing between dits and dahs within a character is the length of one dit; between letters in a word it is the length of a dah (3 dits); and between words it is 7 dits. The Paris standard defines the speed of Morse transmission as the dot and dash timing needed to send the word "Paris" a given number of times per minute. The word Paris is used because it is precisely 50 "dits" based on the text book timing.
Under this standard, the time for one "dit" can be computed by the formula:
T = 1200 / W
Where: W is the desired speed in words-per-minute, and T is one dit-time in milliseconds."
